# TODO List for Drill Analytics Page Implementation

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Create DrillAnalytics.jsx component with drill analytics video, disaster survival text, and animations
- [x] Edit NewsResources.jsx to remove the drill analytics video section
- [x] Edit App.jsx to add routing for the new DrillAnalytics page
- [x] Edit Home.jsx to add navigation button/link to access DrillAnalytics page
- [x] Test the new page for functionality, responsiveness, and UI consistency (Note: Manual testing required - run the app and verify navigation, video playback, animations, and responsiveness)

## Notes:
- Ensure the video iframe is properly embedded in DrillAnalytics.jsx
- Add informative text on different disaster survival options
- Implement CSS animations for visual appeal
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the app
- Verify navigation works correctly from Home page
